config HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS
	bool
	help
	  Some architectures are unable to perform unaligned accesses
	  without the use of get_unaligned/put_unaligned. Others are
	  unable to perform such accesses efficiently (e.g. trap on
	  unaligned access and require fixing it up in the exception
	  handler.)

	  This symbol should be selected by an architecture if it can
	  perform unaligned accesses efficiently to allow different
	  code paths to be selected for these cases. Some network
	  drivers, for example, could opt to not fix up alignment
	  problems with received packets if doing so would not help
	  much.

	  See Documentation/unaligned-memory-access.txt for more
	  information on the topic of unaligned memory accesses.

config ARCH_USE_BUILTIN_BSWAP
       bool
       help
	 Modern versions of GCC (since 4.4) have builtin functions
	 for handling byte-swapping. Using these, instead of the old
	 inline assembler that the architecture code provides in the
	 __arch_bswapXX() macros, allows the compiler to see what's
	 happening and offers more opportunity for optimisation. In
	 particular, the compiler will be able to combine the byteswap
	 with a nearby load or store and use load-and-swap or
	 store-and-swap instructions if the architecture has them. It
	 should almost *never* result in code which is worse than the
	 hand-coded assembler in <asm/swab.h>.  But just in case it
	 does, the use of the builtins is optional.

	 Any architecture with load-and-swap or store-and-swap
	 instructions should set this. And it shouldn't hurt to set it
	 on architectures that don't have such instructions.

config HAVE_ALIGNED_STRUCT_PAGE
	bool
	help
	  This makes sure that struct pages are double word aligned and that
	  e.g. the SLUB allocator can perform double word atomic operations
	  on a struct page for better performance. However selecting this
	  might increase the size of a struct page by a word.

config HAVE_CMPXCHG_DOUBLE
	bool

config HAVE_STACKPROTECTOR
	bool
	help
	  An arch should select this symbol if:
	  - it has implemented a stack canary (e.g. __stack_chk_guard)

config CC_HAS_STACKPROTECTOR_NONE
	def_bool $(cc-option,-fno-stack-protector)

config STACKPROTECTOR
	bool "Stack Protector buffer overflow detection"
	depends on HAVE_STACKPROTECTOR
	depends on $(cc-option,-fstack-protector)
	default y
	help
	  This option turns on the "stack-protector" GCC feature. This
	  feature puts, at the beginning of functions, a canary value on
	  the stack just before the return address, and validates
	  the value just before actually returning.  Stack based buffer
	  overflows (that need to overwrite this return address) now also
	  overwrite the canary, which gets detected and the attack is then
	  neutralized via a kernel panic.

	  Functions will have the stack-protector canary logic added if they
	  have an 8-byte or larger character array on the stack.

	  This feature requires gcc version 4.2 or above, or a distribution
	  gcc with the feature backported ("-fstack-protector").

	  On an x86 "defconfig" build, this feature adds canary checks to
	  about 3% of all kernel functions, which increases kernel code size
	  by about 0.3%.

config STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG
	bool "Strong Stack Protector"
	depends on STACKPROTECTOR
	depends on $(cc-option,-fstack-protector-strong)
	default y
	help
	  Functions will have the stack-protector canary logic added in any
	  of the following conditions:

	  - local variable's address used as part of the right hand side of an
	    assignment or function argument
	  - local variable is an array (or union containing an array),
	    regardless of array type or length
	  - uses register local variables

	  This feature requires gcc version 4.9 or above, or a distribution
	  gcc with the feature backported ("-fstack-protector-strong").

	  On an x86 "defconfig" build, this feature adds canary checks to
	  about 20% of all kernel functions, which increases the kernel code
	  size by about 2%.

config PGTABLE_LEVELS
	int
	default 2

config HAVE_STACK_VALIDATION
	bool
	help
	  Architecture supports the 'objtool check' host tool command, which
	  performs compile-time stack metadata validation.

config HAVE_ARCH_HASH
	bool
	default n
	help
	  If this is set, the architecture provides an <asm/hash.h>
	  file which provides platform-specific implementations of some
	  functions in <linux/hash.h> or fs/namei.c.

config HAVE_ARCH_COMPILER_H
	bool
	help
	  An architecture can select this if it provides an
	  asm/compiler.h header that should be included after
	  linux/compiler-*.h in order to override macro definitions that those
	  headers generally provide.

config ARCH_WANT_LD_ORPHAN_WARN
	bool
	help
	  An arch should select this symbol once all linker sections are explicitly
	  included, size-asserted, or discarded in the linker scripts. This is
	  important because we never want expected sections to be placed heuristically
	  by the linker, since the locations of such sections can change between linker
	  versions.

config CPU_NO_EFFICIENT_FFS
	def_bool n
